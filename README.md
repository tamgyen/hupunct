# hupunct
I aim to fill the gap between Speech Recognition (speech2text) and downstream NLP tasks by developing a model for Automatic Punctuation Restoration (APR) in Hungarian called ‘hupunct’, that has raw unpunctuated lower-cased text as its input, and has the corrected, punctuated text as its output.
